# KSP API Extensions/L :: Changes

* 2019-1018: 2.1.0.17 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.2
	+ New Installment facilities:
		- Checking on compatible Unity version(s) 
	+ Fixing a stupid mistake on handling pathnames that rendered this thing unusable on Windows!
* 2019-1005: 2.1.0.16 (Lisias) for KSP >= 1.2
	+ Preemptive update to support Unity 2019.2 (KSP 1.8) 
	+ Known issue:
		- KSPe.UI doesn't loads on KSP <= 1.3.1 due an idiotic mistake on handling dependencies. Delete it from `000_KSPAPIExtensions/Plugins` as a temporary measure.  
		- See Issue [#3](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/KSPAPIExtensions/issues/3)
